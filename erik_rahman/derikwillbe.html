                <p>Hello, my name is <span>Erik Rahman</span>. As a 4th-semester 
                    Informatics student at Universitas Negeri Padang, 
                    I have a deep interest in UI/UX, frontend development, 
                    and machine learning. Throughout my studies, I have 
                    developed various relevant skills, both in communication 
                    and technical aspects. My experience in IT projects, 
                    such as participating in the development of web-based 
                    applications, has enriched my understanding of user 
                    interface design and user experience (UI/UX), as well 
                    as frontend development. Additionally, I have been involved 
                    in Linux Ubuntu operating system management projects, 
                    which have expanded my understanding of operating systems and 
                    system management.

                <p>I really enjoy painting because it allows me to channel 
                    my expression and imagination into visual form. Each 
                    time I paint, I feel free to experiment with colors and 
                    shapes, creating unique pieces. This activity also helps 
                    me relax and reduce stress after daily routines. Through 
                    painting, I can express myself and see the world from a 
                    more creative perspective.</p>

                <p>i love fixie!. Every Sunday morning, I always make 
                    time to ride my fixie bike. Cycling in the morning 
                    gives me positive energy and freshness, especially 
                    with the cool air and light traffic. Riding a fixie 
                    offers a unique experience because it has no brakes 
                    and only one gear, making each pedal stroke feel more 
                    challenging. I enjoy riding through the city streets 
                    while taking in the calm morning scenery. This activity 
                    also helps me stay fit and maintain my stamina. By 
                    cycling regularly, I experience incredible physical and 
                    mental benefits.</p>
